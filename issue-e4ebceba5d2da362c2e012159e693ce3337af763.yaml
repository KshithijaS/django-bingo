title: Bingo Detection
desc: |-
  Detect when a board has a bingo.
  
  Options for implementation
  - Just from the own votes
  - Use all votes, to check if it is a valid bingo
  - a moderator can decide, which words are valid
  
  This feature may encourage fake votes, so it should
  be possible to disable it.
