title: race conditions while creating games / boards
desc: |-
  When the server is slow, there are race conditions creating games and boards.
  A board is protected by unique_together=[game, ip]/[game,user] in save(), but
  there is a short delay between selecting boards for current user or ip and
  creating a new one.
  A game may be created twice, because the game_id is calculated in save(),
  which leads to errors when selecting a game with .get(game_id=x), because two games
  are returned.
