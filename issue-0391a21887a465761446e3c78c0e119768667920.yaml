title: update cache on vote instead of just invalidating?
desc: |-
  a vote could .update() the database and replace the cache item instead of
  just invalidating the cache, so that the next query updates the votes from database.
  pro: performance
  con: data loaded from db after the cache is deleted is always consistent
